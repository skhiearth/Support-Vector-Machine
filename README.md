Implementing a SVM in Python and R

The dataset is a set of users of a fictitious social network and some of their attributes. The social network wants to use targetted advertising to select users who are likely to purchase a particular product. Attributes of the users are key in determining the outcome of their purchases, and hence a SVM is developed to improve the targetted advertising.
